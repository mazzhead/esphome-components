**ESPHone components**

When I bought what I thought was a qmc5883l magnetometer as that one is standard available in ESPHome.
But got the qmc5883p board. After some thoughts went for copying and adapting the qmc5883l component 
to be able to deal with this one. Has some other control options so needed to adjust the code for that. 

No fork and stuff, all too new for me, but probably when this evolves.

In the subfolders each components is listed, for now just this qmc5883p component.
