**ESPHone components**

Went down the rabbithole when I bought what I thought was a qmc5883l magnetometer as that one is standard available in ESPHome.
But got the qmc5883p board. After some thoughts went for copying and adapting the qmc5883l component to be able to deal with this one. Has some other control options
so needed to adjust the code for that. No fork and stuff, all too new for me.

In the components folder each one is listed, for now just one.
